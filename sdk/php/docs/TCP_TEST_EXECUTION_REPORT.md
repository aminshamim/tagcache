| HEALTH | HTTP-specific | ✅ Proper exception | Use HTTP |
| LIST | Not implemented | ✅ Proper exception | Use HTTP |
| AUTH_SETUP | Limited support | ✅ Proper exception | Use HTTP |

## Recommendations

### Production Deployment
1. **Connection Pool Size**: Scale to 5-10 connections for production workloads
2. **Timeout Configuration**: Use 5-10 second timeouts for production reliability
3. **Error Handling**: Implement fallback to HTTP for unsupported operations
4. **Monitoring**: Track connection pool utilization and error rates

### Performance Optimization
1. **Bulk Operations**: Prefer bulk operations for multiple key scenarios
2. **Connection Reuse**: Maintain persistent connections for high-frequency operations
3. **Payload Size**: TCP excels with small-to-medium payloads (<100KB)
4. **Tag Strategy**: Use targeted tag invalidation vs full cache flush

### Error Handling Strategy
```php
// Recommended error handling pattern
try {
    $result = $tcpTransport->get($key);
} catch (ApiException $e) {
    if (str_contains($e->getMessage(), 'not supported over TCP')) {
        // Fall back to HTTP transport
        return $httpTransport->get($key);
    }
    // Handle other errors (connection, timeout, etc.)
    throw $e;
}
```
