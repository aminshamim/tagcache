echo "‚úÖ Separate connect timeout: Added 3000ms\n";
echo "‚úÖ Pool size increased: 4 ‚Üí 8 connections (better concurrency)\n";
echo "‚úÖ Retry logic: Added max_retries=3 with 100ms delay\n";
echo "‚úÖ TCP optimization: Added tcp_nodelay=true (lower latency)\n";
echo "‚úÖ Keep-alive: Added keep_alive=true with 30s interval\n";
echo "‚úÖ Better defaults for production workloads\n";
